              Hi there! I am a Computer Science student currently studying at
              Monash University Malaysia. I am a passionate coder who loves to
              invent applications to solve simple or even complex problems. I
              mostly spend most of my free time making fun projects with React
              or Vue. I also love working with great teams and always give my
              best when contributing something.
              <br />
              <br />
              Now I am hungry for a real-world experience and currently seeking
              internships for software-based works.
            </p>

        tuition center back at my hometown in Jakarta to create several fun
        games for young children to learn Mandarin as a fun activity. It was a
        really, really fun experience working with the staff and teachers! I
        learned so much from them, from interacting with the locals and also
        learning a bit of Mandarin along the way! I also created the games with
        React and p5js, with my knowledge from my coding bootcamp React
        training. From this experience, I'm proud to be able to use my knowledge
        to create something that benefits someone!"

              coding bootcamp. After learning Bootstrap from Coursera, I decided
              to step up and learn React as my next stepping stone in front-end
              web development. Overall it was one of the best decisions of my
              life! I learned so much, from state management using Redux to a
              gentle introduction into React Native. I also made a Github
              repository statistical dashboard as my final project."

              any cool prizes or anything, the experience and connections I made
              was very valuable. I learned so much from this hackathon: I
              stepped up my communication skills and gained a leadership
              personality by leading the team with a list of ideas and
              inspiration, all in within a tight schedule!"

              Soft-Skills. My team and I was tasked in creating an algorithm
              using Python with speed and time complexity being the priority, to
              match a list of candidates in a company with the best and cost
              efficient skills. I used hash tables, performed white-box testing
              to ensure all test cases are handled, and also used decorators to
              calculate runtime performance. In the end, we won and came first
              in the hackathon!"
